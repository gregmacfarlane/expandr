# Introduction

This package provides a generic implimentation of the iterative proportional 
fitting algorithm or
[IPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_proportional_fitting) in the
`ipf()` function. It also provides an iterative proportional updating algorithm
based on on the paper from Arizona State University 
([IPU](http://www.scag.ca.gov/Documents/PopulationSynthesizerPaper_TRB.pdf)) for
balancing household- and person-level marginals in the `ipu()` function.

# IPU

Iterative proportional updating is a method developed by Arizona State University
that allows the IPF procedure to match household- and person-level marginals. In
the basic IPF procedure, all marginal distributions must describe the same thing
(e.g. households). IPU allows you to say, for example, that a zone needs a total
household count of 500, but also needs 800 people.

## Example 1: Simple Example

This example creates a random seed table and target values to illustrate how the
package is used. The targets are specified for two separate geographies
(`geo_clusters`). Any field name can be used as long as it:

  * starts with "geo_"
  * Is included in both the target table(s) and seed table

This simple example only has one target marginal distribution, and could be
solved directly without `ipu`. However, it is designed to show the basics needed
to run the function.

### Seed table creation
The seed table is the starting point for the IPF procedure. In this example, we
make up some survey data.

  * Each row represents a household
  * The household ID column is named/renamed to `pid` ("primary ID")
  * The geography field is included and starts with "geo_" (`geo_taz`)
    * There are two traffic analysis zones (TAZs), each with different
      seed data and targets.

```{r}
hh_seed <- tribble(
  ~pid, ~siz, ~inc, ~weight, ~geo_taz,
  1,    1,    1,    12,       1,
  2,    1,    2,     3,       1,
  3,    2,    1,    6,       1,
  4,    2,    2,    5,       1
)
```

### Target creation
The number of households by size (e.g., 1-person, 2-person, etc.) is referred to
as a marginal distribution.  Often, from the Census, we know the total number of
households by each individual marginal. This information becomes the target that
the IPU process tries to match.

Marginal targets are specified below for each taz:

  * The geography field `geo_taz` matches the seed table.
  * The name of the table in the list links it to the `siz` and `inc` columns of the     seed.
  * The column names are the values that show up in the seed's `siz` and `inc`
    columns.

```{r}
hh_targets <- list()
hh_targets$siz <- tribble(
  ~geo_taz, ~`1`, ~`2`,
  1,        18,   12
)
hh_targets$inc <- tribble(
  ~geo_taz, ~`1`, ~`2`,
  1,        20,  10
)

hh_targets
```

### Run IPU

```{r}
result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets)
```

`ipu()` returns a named list.

```{r}
names(result)
```

The first element is the resulting weight table. It is the primary seed table
with three columns added:

  * weight
    * The expanded weight of the record.
  * avg_weight
    * The average weight for the geography (total target / number of seed records)
  * weight_factor
    * The weight divided by the average weight.

```{r}
result$weight_tbl
```

The second element is a histogram of the `weight_factor`. This provides a quick
overview of the distribution of weights.

```{r}
result$weight_dist
```

The next element is a comparison back to the targets provided. With complex
seed and target tables, this makes investigating results quick and easy.

```{r}
result$primary_comp
```

If secondary targets are provided to `ipu()`, a fourth item in the list will
contain a `secondary_comp` table.

In addition to making sure the marginal targets are matched, it is important to
ensure that the underlying distribution of households still resembles the seed
data. As an example, if your seed data says that most low-income households are
also one-person households, that information should be preserved.

```{r}
hh_seed %>%
  mutate(inc = paste0("inc", inc)) %>%
  filter(geo_taz == 1) %>%
  select(siz, inc, weight) %>%
  spread(inc, weight)

result$weight_tbl %>%
  mutate(inc = paste0("inc", inc)) %>%
  filter(geo_taz == 1) %>%
  select(siz, inc, weight) %>%
  spread(inc, weight)
```


## Example 2: The Arizona Paper Example

In household survey expansion, it is common to want to control for certain 
features that describe households, (like size), while controlling for other 
attributes that describe people (like age). This is possible with the `ipu()`
function.

This example is taken directly from the Arizona paper on page 20:
http://www.scag.ca.gov/Documents/PopulationSynthesizerPaper_TRB.pdf

In this example, household type could represent size (e.g. 1-person and 2-person
households). Person type could represent age groups (e.g. under 18, between
18 and 50, and over 50).

The code block below re-creates the seed and target tables for both persons
and households.

  * Only a single geography is used (`geo_region`)
  * Both seed tables have the `pid` field
    * The `pid` field in the persons seed table links to the household seed

```{r arizona inputs}
hh_seed <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  pid = c(1:8),
  hhtype = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
)

per_seed <- data_frame(
  pid = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8),
  pertype = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2)
)

hh_targets <- list()
hh_targets$hhtype <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  `1` = 35,
  `2` = 65
)

per_targets <- list()
per_targets$pertype <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  `1` = 91,
  `2` = 65,
  `3` = 104
)
```

In the interst of keeping vignette build time short, the `ipu()` algorithm is 
only run for 30 iterations. After running for 400 or more iterations, the 
results match closely to those shown in the paper.

  * The household seed table is the `primary_seed`
  * The household target list is the `primary_target`
  * The person seed table is the `secondary_seed`
  * The person target list is the `secondary_target`

```{r arizona ipu}
result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, per_seed, per_targets, max_iterations = 30)
```

The first table shows the result. The second table shows the primary comparison
table. Since we added secondary seeds and targets, the output now contains
a secondary comparison table. Feel free to run the code chunk above for
400 or more iterations and then look again.

```{r arizona results}
result$weight_tbl %>%
  mutate(weight = round(weight, 2))
  
result$primary_comp %>% 
  mutate(result = round(result, 2))

result$secondary_comp %>% 
  mutate(result = round(result, 2))
```


## Example 3: Using Multiple Geographies

`ipu()` allows different geographies to be specified for different marginal
tables. There are a few rules that make this possible, but in short, the geo
field on each target table tells the algorithm which scale to constrain to.

All of the following rules are checked by the algorithm a warning message will
show if one is violated.

  * The primary/household seed table must contain all geo fields used by any
    target table and the `pid` field.
    * Do **not** put any geo fields on the secondary/person seed table.
    * This prevents potential errors/inconsistencies between seed tables.
  * All fields that designate geographies must start with "geo_" e.g.
    * geo_cluster
    * geo_region
    * geo_state
  * Each target table must have a geo field that is present in the primary seed 
    table

To demonstrate, the Arizona example from example 1 is modified to add two
different clusters for household controls but to still control the person
targets at the regional level.

```{r multigeo inputs}
# Modifying example 1 for example 2

# Repeat the hh_seed to create cluster 1 and 2 households
hh_seed <- hh_seed %>%
  rename(geo_cluster = geo_region)
hh_seed <- bind_rows(
  hh_seed,
  hh_seed %>% 
    mutate(geo_cluster = 2, pid = pid + 8)
)
hh_seed$geo_region = 1

hh_seed

# Repeat the household targets for two clusters
hh_targets$hhtype <- bind_rows(hh_targets$hhtype, hh_targets$hhtype)
hh_targets$hhtype <- hh_targets$hhtype %>%
  rename(geo_cluster = geo_region) %>%
  mutate(geo_cluster = c(1, 2))

hh_targets$hhtype

# Repeat the per_seed to create cluster 1 and 2 persons
per_seed <- bind_rows(
  per_seed,
  per_seed %>% 
    mutate(pid = pid + 8)
)

per_seed %>%
  head()

# Double the regional person targets
per_targets$pertype <- per_targets$pertype %>%
  mutate_at(
    .vars = vars("1", "2", "3"),
    .funs = funs(. * 2)
  )

per_targets$pertype
```

Run the IPU algorithm. Again, for vignette build time, only 30 iterations are
performed. Run the code yourself with `max_iterations` set to 600 to see the
converged result.

```{r multigeo ipu}
result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, per_seed, per_targets, max_iterations = 30)
```

The tables below show the results compared back to targets. More iterations
would make a better match.

```{r multigeo results}
result$primary_comp %>%
  mutate(result = round(result, 2))

result$secondary_comp %>%
  mutate(result = round(result, 2))
```

# How IPU addresses common IPF problems

This section will show how `ipu()` addresses some common problems found in basic
ipf procedures. It uses the example data from the first example.

## Zero weights

IPF works by successively multiplying the table weights by factors.  Cells with 
a zero weight cannot be modified by this process.  As the number of zero weights 
increase, the flexibility of the process is reduced, and convergence becomes 
more difficult. `ipfr` solves this problem by setting a minimum weight for all 
cells to `.0001`.  This minimum weight can be adjusted using the `min_weight` 
parameter and should be arbitrarily small compared to your seed table weights.

## Missing seed information

Not every combination of marginal categories is required to be included in the 
seed table; however, at least one observation of each category must exist.  For example, the combination:

  * siz = 1
  * wrk = 1
  * veh = 0

may not have been observed in the survey, and thus may be missing from the seed 
table.  As long as other combinations of size-1 households exist (e.g. with 0 workers and 1 vehicle), `ipfr` will work fine.  On the other hand, if there are no observations of any size-1 households, `ipfr` will stop with an error message.

See the first IPU example to see how it works.

## Target agreement

`ipfr` handles two separate issues concerning marginal agreement:

  * Agreement within primary or secondary targets
  * Balance between primary and secondary targets

### Agreement within Primary or Secondary Targets

A basic implementation of iterative proportional fitting requires that all 
targets agree on the total. For example, if the households by size target table
has a total of 100 households, but the households by income table has a total
of 120, both cannot be satisfied.

`ipfr` handles this by scaling all tables in the same target list (either
primary or secondary) to match the total of the first table.

In the example below, the size marginal sums to a total of 100 households.
The vehicle marginal sums to 300. With the `verbose` option set to `TRUE`,
a message will be displayed telling which, if any, target tables are scaled.

```{r, warning=TRUE}
hh_seed <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  pid = c(1:8),
  hhsiz = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
  hhveh = c(0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0)
)

hh_targets <- list()
hh_targets$hhsiz <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  `1` = 35,
  `2` = 65
)
hh_targets$hhveh <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  `0` = 100,
  `1` = 100,
  `2` = 100
)

result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, max_iterations = 30, verbose = TRUE)
```

Importantly, the performance measures below compare the result to the scaled
target not the original. Note that the vehicle targets have been scaled down.

```{r}
result$primary_comp %>%
  mutate_at(
    .vars = vars(target, result),
    .funs = funs(round(., 2))
  )
```

### Balance Between Primary and Secondary Targets

In population synthesis or survey expansion, adding a secondary set of person- 
level targets can lead to a different issue: target balance. Naturally, the
total number of households and the total number of persons will be very
different. A balance issue arises when the *average* weight for household
records and person records are very different.

In the Arizona example, note that the average weights for household and person
records are similar.

```{r balance example inputs, include=FALSE}
hh_seed <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  pid = c(1:8),
  hhtype = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
)

per_seed <- data_frame(
  pid = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8),
  pertype = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2)
)

hh_targets <- list()
hh_targets$hhtype <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  `1` = 35,
  `2` = 65
)

per_targets <- list()
per_targets$pertype <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  `1` = 91,
  `2` = 65,
  `3` = 104
)
```

```{r}
avg_hh_weight <- (rowSums(hh_targets$hhtype) - 1) / nrow(hh_seed)
avg_per_weight <- (rowSums(per_targets$pertype) - 1) / nrow(per_seed)
```

  * Average household weight = `r avg_hh_weight`
  * Average person weight = `r round(avg_per_weight, 2)`

In real applications, this is often not true. The example below demonstrates the
consequences by modifying the Arizona to double the person targets.

```{r}
per_targets$pertype <- per_targets$pertype %>%
  mutate_at(
    .vars = vars(`1`, `2`, `3`),
    .funs = funs(. * 2)
  )

result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, per_seed, per_targets, max_iterations = 30)
```

The resulting weights tend towards the extreme as the algorithm attempts to
match unbalanced primary and secondary targets. In effect, the algorithm is
making a large shift to the basic persons-per-household metric found in the seed
table. Households with mutiple people get large weights, while households with a
single person get small weights.

```{r}
result$weight_dist
```

`ipu` can fix the underlying problem using the `secondary_importance` argument.
It is `1` by default, which means the algorithm will attempt to match the
absolute values of the secondary targets (as above). As this value is decreased
to 0, the secondary targets are scaled to match the average weight of the
primary targets.

The examples below set `secondary_importance` to `0.80`, `0.20`, and `0.00` to
show the effect on results. With each decrease in importance, the match to
person targets gets worse, but weight extremes are reduced.

```{r}
result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, per_seed, per_targets, max_iterations = 30,
              secondary_importance = .80)

result
```

```{r}
result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, per_seed, per_targets, max_iterations = 30,
              secondary_importance = .20)

result
```

```{r}
result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, per_seed, per_targets, max_iterations = 30,
              secondary_importance = 0)

result
```

## Extreme Weights

Often, it is preferable to constrain weights so that certain, under-sampled
observations to do not end up with extreme weights. `ipu()` supports this by
using the `min_ratio` and `max_ratio` variables.

First, the average weight is calculated **per geography** based on the total of 
the target tables divided by the number of records in the seed table. Then, the 
max and min factors set a cap and floor based on a multiple of that average.

Common values to use are:

  * max_ratio = 5 (5x the average weight)
  * min_ratio = .2 (1/5 the average weight)

However, care should be taken when moving these variables from their default
values. These variables impose another constraint on the algorithm and increase
the chance of failure. In the example below, very strict values are used with
the same seed and target data from IPU Example 1.

Values of 1.2 and .8 mean that all weights must be within 20% of the average
weight.

```{r}
hh_seed <- data_frame(
  pid = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  siz = c(1, 2, 2, 1),
  weight = c(1, 1, 1, 1),
  geo_cluster = c(1, 1, 2, 2)
)

hh_targets <- list()
hh_targets$siz <- data_frame(
  geo_cluster = c(1, 2),
  `1` = c(75, 100),
  `2` = c(25, 150)
)

result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, max_iterations = 10,
              max_ratio = 1.2, min_ratio = .8)
```

Consider the effect on geo_cluster 1. With a total target of 100 households and
two records in the seed table, the average weight is 50. This means that the
weights must be between 40 and 60. The algorithm does not have enough flexibility
to meet the controls.

```{r}
result$primary_comp
```

A second problem can arrise from capping weights based on the average weight. In
the example below, I change the targets so that, for geo_cluster 1, they are 
very unbalanced. Cluster 1 now has 100,000 1-person households but only 5 
2-person households. 

```{r}
hh_targets <- list()
hh_targets$siz <- data_frame(
  geo_cluster = c(1, 2),
  `1` = c(100000, 100),
  `2` = c(5, 150)
)

result <- ipu(hh_seed, hh_targets, max_iterations = 10,
              max_ratio = 5, min_ratio = .2)

result$primary_comp
```

Even with reasonable values for the weight caps, the minimum allowable weight is
much higher than 5. This is an extreme example, and is unlikely to be an issue
in applications related to housing and population - the targets are generally on
the same scale. However, when expanding a through-trip table, it is common to
have some external stations with large targets and others with small. In these
cases, it is advisable to leave the scale arguments at their default values.

# IPU_NR

The function `ipu_nr` only differs from `ipu` in one significant way: the method
used to balance primary and secondary targets.

```{r, include=FALSE}
hh_seed <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  pid = c(1:8),
  hhtype = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
)

per_seed <- data_frame(
  pid = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8),
  pertype = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2)
)

hh_targets <- list()
hh_targets$hhtype <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  `1` = 35,
  `2` = 65
)

per_targets <- list()
per_targets$pertype <- data_frame(
  geo_region = 1,
  `1` = 91,
  `2` = 65,
  `3` = 104
)
```

As in the more detailed `ipu` example above, we modify the Arizona example
(which is balanced) to double the person targets. This creates a significant
imbalance that standard approahces struggle with.

```{r}
per_targets$pertype <- per_targets$pertype %>%
  mutate_at(
    .vars = vars(`1`, `2`, `3`),
    .funs = funs(. * 2)
  )
```

While `ipu` balances the secondary targets directly using `secondary_importance`,
`ipu_nr` uses an iterative approach and the `target_priority` argument. 

By default, all target tables have an equally high priority, which means that the
algorithm will attempt to match all targets exactly. However, `target_priority`
can be modified in several ways. In the code below, a data frame is used to
assign the `hhtype` target a higher priority. (If using a data frame, the column
names must be `target` and `priority`.) A simple named list can also be used
(both options shown below).

```{r}
# Option 1: a data frame
target_priority <- data_frame(
  target = c("hhtype", "pertype"),
  priority = c(10000, 10)
)

# Options 2: use a named list
target_priority <- list()
target_priority$hhtype <- 10000
target_priority$pertype <- 10

result <- ipu_nr(hh_seed, hh_targets, per_seed, per_targets, max_iterations = 30,
              target_priority = target_priority)
```

As `ipu_nr` runs, it relaxes the target constraints on `pertype` much faster than
on `hhtype`. As a result, the final weights will match the household type much
closer. The two methods generally match targets to the same degree, but often
lead to very different distributions of weight ratios. In addition, `ipu` tends
to reach convergence levels around .1 %RMSE faster than `ipu_nr`, but for levels
below that, `ipu_nr` tends to be faster.

```{r}
result
```
