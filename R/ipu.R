#' ipfr: A package to perform iterative proportional fitting
#' 
#' There are currently three functions 
#' 
#' \code{\link{ipf}} (deprecated)
#' 
#' \code{\link{ipu}}
#' 
#' \code{\link{ipu_nr}}
#' 
#' Both \code{ipu} and \code{ipu_nr} implement list balancing. \code{ipu_nr}
#' implements a newton-raphson approach to balance primary and secondary
#' targets. \code{ipu} balances targets directly, which can mean faster
#' convergence.

#' Iterative Proportional Updating
#' 
#' @description A general case of iterative proportional fitting. It can satisfy
#'   two, disparate sets of marginals that do not agree on a single total. A
#'   common example is balancing population data using household- and person-level
#'   marginal controls. This could be for survey expansion or synthetic
#'   population creation. The second set of marginal/seed data is optional, meaning
#'   it can also be used for more basic IPF tasks.

#' 
#' @param primary_seed In population synthesis or household survey expansion, 
#'   this would be the household seed table (each record would represent a 
#'   household). It could also be a trip table, where each row represents an 
#'   origin-destination pair. Must contain a \code{pid} ("primary ID") field
#'   that is unique for each row. Must also contain a geography field that
#'   starts with "geo_".
#' 
#' @param primary_targets A \code{named list} of data frames.  Each name in the 
#'   list defines a marginal dimension and must match a column from the 
#'   \code{primary_seed} table. The data frame associated with each named list
#'   element must contain a geography field (starts with "geo_"). Each row in
#'   the target table defines a new geography (these could be TAZs, tracts,
#'   clusters, etc.). The other column names define the marginal categories that
#'   targets are provided for. The vignette provides more detail.
#' 
#' @param secondary_seed Most commonly, if the primary_seed describes households, the 
#'   secondary seed table would describe a unique person with each row. Must
#'   also contain the \code{pid} column that links each person to their 
#'   respective household in \code{primary_seed}. Must not contain any geography
#'   fields (starting with "geo_").
#' 
#' @param secondary_targets Same format as \code{primary_targets}, but they constrain 
#'   the \code{secondary_seed} table.
#'   
#' @param secondary_importance A \code{real} between 0 and 1 signifying the 
#'   importance of the secondary targets. At an importance of 1, the function
#'   will try to match the secondary tarets exactly. At 0, only the percentage
#'   distributions are used (see the vignette section "Target Agreement".)
#' 
#' @param relative_gap After each iteration, the weights are compared to the
#' previous weights and the %RMSE is calculated. If the %RMSE is less than
#' the \code{relative_gap} threshold, then the process terminates.
#' 
#' @param max_iterations maximimum number of iterations to perform, even if 
#'    \code{relative_gap} is not reached.
#'    
#' @param absolute_diff Upon completion, the \code{ipu()} function will report
#'   the worst-performing marginal category and geography based on the percent
#'   difference from the target. \code{absolute_diff} is a threshold below which
#'   percent differences don't matter.
#'   
#'   For example, if if a target value was 2, and the expanded weights equaled
#'   1, that's a 100% difference, but is not important because the absolute value
#'   is only 1.
#'   
#'   Defaults to 10.
#'   
#' @param weight_floor Minimum weight to allow in any cell to prevent zero
#'   weights. Set to .0001 by default.  Should be arbitrarily small compared to
#'   your seed table weights.
#'   
#' @param verbose Print iteration details and worst marginal stats upon 
#'   completion? Default \code{FALSE}.
#'   
#' @param max_ratio \code{real} number. The average weight per seed record is
#' calculated by dividing the total of the targets by the number of records.
#' The max_scale caps the maximum weight at a multiple of that average. Defaults
#' to \code{10000} (basically turned off).
#' 
#' @param min_ratio \code{real} number. The average weight per seed record is
#' calculated by dividing the total of the targets by the number of records.
#' The min_scale caps the minimum weight at a multiple of that average. Defaults
#' to \code{0.0001} (basically turned off).
#' 
#' @return a \code{named list} with the \code{primary_seed} with weight, a 
#'   histogram of the weight distribution, and two comparison tables to aid in
#'   reporting.
